# Volume knob

Did you know that the ESP32-S3 can be used as a HID (Human Interface Device)? Basically, you can program it to act as a keyboard or mouse. I am using this feature in this project.

The project also uses a Makerfabs MaTouch 1.28' rotary display, and it is used to show data on the volume controll.
